# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM Neural Network
A machine learning project using an LSTM neural network to predict the closing stock price of Apple Inc., based on 60-day historical data. Implemented in Python on Google Colab, this model leverages time series analysis to enhance forecasting accuracy in financial data.

# Features:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for stock price prediction
- LSTM model implementation and training in TensorFlow
- Visualization of predictions vs. actual prices for performance analysis
